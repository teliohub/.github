## About

We are a product company that is concentrated on delivering high quality products in the field of Space / Cosmos.

Our philosophy is rapid development and feedback!

## The product


The first project we are developing is Artiscape Boutique. This is a project that would allow astrophotographers and space artists to monetize and share their work.

Uploading images, portfolio page, galleries, verification system, monetizable articles and videos and many more.

## The development

What do we mean by rapid development and feedback?

We believe that software has to grow fast and ship fast. New features have to be developed all the time.

We absolutely hate working with software that hasn’t changed in years! And that’s why we don’t! Bugs staying with months and months.. not appealing to us!

Feedback is essential for doing just that. Every paying user would have the ability to vote and propose features. The most voted ideas are going to be built!

That’s what we call democracy in software!
